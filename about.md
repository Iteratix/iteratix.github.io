## About ASL LOVE

What do American Sign Language, music, and movement have in common? Rhythm and the human spirit. ASL Love is a collective that is focused on
exploring and expanding the intersection between ASL, music, and dance.

### Events
ASL<3 will be hosting an series of events to showcase Deaf artists who are working with ASL, music, and/or movement -- and to have fun! Please [contact us](/contact.html)
